##Shell Scripts Basics.
Here are Shell Script basics to keep in mind, especially if you’re working with Bash (the most common shell):
1. Shebang (Interpreter)

Start scripts with:

#!/bin/bash


Tells the system which shell should run the script.

2. Make Script Executable
chmod +x script.sh
./script.sh


Or run with:

bash script.sh

3. Comments
# This is a comment


Use comments to explain why, not just what.

4. Variables

No spaces around =

name="Alex"
echo "$name"


Use quotes to avoid bugs with spaces.

5. User Input
read username
read -p "Enter name: " username

6. Arguments
$0  # script name
$1  # first argument
$2  # second argument
$@  # all arguments
$#  # number of arguments

7. Conditionals
if [ "$a" -eq 10 ]; then
  echo "Ten"
elif [ "$a" -gt 10 ]; then
  echo "Greater"
else
  echo "Less"
fi


⚠️ Spaces inside [ ] are required.

8. Loops

For loop

for i in 1 2 3; do
  echo $i
done


While loop

while [ $x -lt 5 ]; do
  echo $x
  ((x++))
done

9. Exit Status

0 = success

Non-zero = failure

command
echo $?

10. Functions
greet() {
  echo "Hello $1"
}
greet Alex

11. Quoting Rules (Very Important)

" " → expands variables

' ' → literal text (no expansion)

`cmd` or $(cmd) → command substitution (prefer $())

12. File Tests
-f file   # exists and is file
-d dir    # directory
-r file   # readable
-w file   # writable
-x file   # executable

13. Debugging
bash -x script.sh


Or inside script:

set -x
set +x

14. Safety Tips

Always quote variables:

rm "$file"


Use set -e to stop on errors

Use set -u to catch unset variables
