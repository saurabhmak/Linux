In Linux normal user on terminal represent with $, while root/admin user on terminal represent with #
To run command from normal user on terminal, run with sudo in front of command like user@ubuntu:~$ sudo apt install package_name
To become root, run below command from normal user terminal user@ubuntu:~$ sudo su - + enter # This will prompt you for password, put the password of account user; after putting the password, you will become root like-
user@ ubuntu:~$ sudo su -
[sudo] password for user: root@ ubuntu:~#
Below is the list of command that we learn and used during the Assignments of Linux Essentials:-
•
whoami # Command to check the username/account from which, I am logged in.
•
sudo su - # To become root, to run all command as a root user.
•
sudo command_name # To run command from normal account with root privileges.
•
pwd # To check current working directory, where I am.
•
useradd # Command to create user
•
passwd # Command to set the password of newly created user
•
ls # Command to check list of files & directories in current working directory
•
ls -lh # Command to check list of files & directories in current working directory with details like Permission, Ownership of user, Ownership of group, Timestamp in human readable format
•
ls -lha # Command to check list of files & directories in current working directory including hidden files with details like Permission, Ownership of user, Ownership of group, Timestamp in human readable format
•
mkdir # Command to create directory
•
touch # Command to create empty files
•
cd # Command to change directory
•
cd .. # Command to go one directory up
•
cp # Command to copy the filename within directory or out of directory on same server/vm
•
rm # Command to remove files & directory
•
rm -f # Command to remove files & directory forcefully
•
mv # Command to move/rename the files & directory
•
find # Command to search the files & directory
•
locate # This command was not installed by default, package belongs to this command is locate, we need to install it like $ sudo apt install locate, after that update this database with command updatedb
•
chmod # Command to change the permissions of files & directories
•
chown # Command to change the ownership of files & directories
•
chgrp # Command to change the group permissions of files & directories
In Linux, both find and locate are used to search for files, but they work very differently. Here’s a clear comparison:
Key Differences Between find and locate
1. How They Search
Feature
find
locate
Search method
Searches the actual filesystem in real time
Searches a pre-built database (mlocate.db)
Speed
Slower (walks directories live)
Very fast (simple text lookup)
2. Data Freshness
find
locate
Up-to-date results?
Always accurate
May be outdated if the database hasn’t been updated
find
locate
Database update?
Not needed
Uses updatedb (usually run daily by cron/systemd timer)
3. Usage Style
•
find
o
Highly flexible: can filter by name, size, type, permissions, time, ownership, etc.
o
Can run actions like -exec, -delete, -print, etc.
o
Example:
o
find /home -name "*.txt"
•
locate
o
Simple: search by name only (supports patterns).
o
Example:
o
locate myfile.txt
4. Requirements
find
locate
Needs filesystem access?
Yes
No (just searches the DB)
Works on newly created files?
Yes
Not until DB updates
5. Permissions
•
find respects file permissions and only shows what the user can access.
•
locate might show paths to files the user can’t read (but usually hides content), depending on implementation.
When to Use Which
Use find when:
•
You need real-time results.
•
You're looking for files using attributes other than name (size, date, permissions…).
•
You want to perform actions (delete, move, exec commands).
Use locate when:
•
You want fast lookups by filename.
•
You don’t need exact real-time accuracy.
•
You’re searching a large filesystem and speed matters.
Summary (One-liner)
•
find searches the filesystem live — accurate but slower.
•
locate searches a database — very fast but can be outdated.
